 * Specialization of the {@link Component} annotation indicating that the annotated bean is an orchestrator. An
 * orchestrator interacts with the domain model (typically through domain services) and with
 * {@linkplain ApplicationServiceDelegate application service delegates} in response to domain events. An orchestrator
 * typically controls transactions but only enforces security when it makes sense, taking into account that some of the
 * events may have been published by a background thread running without a security context.
